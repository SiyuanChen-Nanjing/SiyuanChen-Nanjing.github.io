I am a third year PhD candidate in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Ken Mai](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/mai-ken.html). My research interests are in flexible hardware acceleration of deep learning.   

Prior to CMU, I graduated from Duke University with my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering. During my undergrad I worked with Prof. Krishnendu Chakrabarty on hardware security.
