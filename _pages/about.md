I am a 3rd year PhD student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, advised by [Prof. Ken Mai](https://www.ece.cmu.edu/directory/bios/mai-ken.html). My research interests are in flexible hardware acceleration of deep learning.   

Prior to CMU, I graduated from Duke University with my BS in Electrical and Computer Engineering. During my undergrad I worked with [Prof. Krishnendu Chakrabarty](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishnendu-chakrabarty-2521186) on hardware security.
